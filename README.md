## Easy Test
I used the DirichletProcess package to fit mixture models to the Faithful, Iris, and Palmer Penguins datasets. The process showed how Dirichlet Process Mixture Models (DPMMs) handle clustering without a fixed number of groups.
I had to clean missing values in the Penguins dataset before fitting the model.
